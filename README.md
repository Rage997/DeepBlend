# DeepBlend: A blender add-on to allow neural networks in Blender's material node system

> Allow neural netowkrs to run within Blender's material node system

With the increasing interestet of deep-learning techniques in visual arts I thought it would be great to allow such networks to be used in Blender's material node system.

# TODO
- [ ] There's no progress bar and Blender freezes when a neural network is running
